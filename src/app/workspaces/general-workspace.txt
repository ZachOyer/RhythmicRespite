Speculum vitreum - A glass mirror

Vitrum a speculo - glass from the mirror

Vitrum speculis - glass that mirrors

The mirrored glass is the view we need to live our lives with.
The mirror allows us to see ourselves, never forgetting to think
about us and our place in the world. But the translucency of the
glass allows us to see others as well. Our thoughts should consider
both ourselves and those around us

And we can take steps closer or farther away to find the perfect distance
from the mirror, such that our reflection fits where we want to be in our
life and who we want to be surrounded by. And when I found the spot that I
like, I swap places with my reflection. I find myself where I want to be,
surrounded by those I want to be surrounded by, and I look back to my old
new reflection, and I see it smile. I see... Me smile







They say those who are heartless once cared too much,
A curse born to those who lack a gentle touch
I stand and stare into that clouded abyss
Of where I might be if life goes amiss
A place void of love and comfort and care
With no hope of curing the chronic despair
But I'm not yet enveloped whole by the black
A race with the clock to make it back
An outstretched hand is all I can afford
Unsure of what I'm reaching toward
I manage to grab hold of my saving grace
Pulled from the deep of shadow's embrace
The face of salvation I did not expect
An appearance that mine does partially reflect
Plucked from gloom by my sweet tender child
We locked our twin eyes and simply just smiled
A reason to live for and cause to die for
An innocent embodiment of immense ardor
By whatever means that fate has brought her
I'll cherish the honor to call her my daughter

And as you grow older I'll be there for you
Doting as much as most fathers do
A life filled with games and vast pillow forts
I'll be the jester of your royal courts
I'll watch as the princess becomes the queen
An adult, for sure, but still my lil bean
Pondering love as you fish from the sea
Its not rocket science, its chemistry
You'll find that one person who makes you merry
Whoever they are, they won't stop me from caring
Linking our arms as we walk down the aisle
Bittersweet moments filled with tears and a smile
Someday you'll know the feeling as well
A young one inside your abdominal cell
And as they grow you'll come to find
Its naught but them thats on your mind
And naught in this world that can compare
To the moments that we may share

But you aren't a triumph that's solely mine
My sweet second self for whom I do pine
She'll be more than just a means to an end
A stunning soulmate and lifelong friend
But a liar I'd be if I said I didn't yearn
For the news of a daughter, despite my stomach's churn
Like a wolf on the prowl, I'm searching for my dear
Pursuing my dreams helps me escape my fear
A world where you never get to exist
A nightmare that I franticly resist
Time is a fire and my life is the fuse
Waiting for my chance to have something to lose
