Speculum vitreum - A glass mirror

Vitrum a speculo - glass from the mirror

Vitrum speculis - glass that mirrors

The mirrored glass is the view we need to live our lives with.
The mirror allows us to see ourselves, never forgetting to think
about us and our place in the world. But the translucency of the
glass allows us to see others as well. Our thoughts should consider
both ourselves and those around us

And we can take steps closer or farther away to find the perfect distance
from the mirror, such that our reflection fits where we want to be in our
life and who we want to be surrounded by. And when I found the spot that I
like, I swap places with my reflection. I find myself where I want to be,
surrounded by those I want to be surrounded by, and I look back to my old
new reflection, and I see it smile. I see... Me smile

Lachrymose

A crash of swords to begin our story
Riddled with death but not that gorey
The man who fought was pure of heart
Against the foe who'd tear him apart
Clash clang shing, ting tang thud
The pure man feel to the mud
His foe had won unfortunately
But the man was good, how could this be?

"Any last words?" his fatigued foe said
"Before I make that mud your bed."
The pure man thought about his life
He thought about his kids and wife
"Not to you..." He said and spit
With stroke of sword his soul did split
The man then watched his limp body lay
And surveyed the place that it would stay
grey and grim, and dark and dank
even without his nose it stank
"Fear not my child," spoke from behind
He turned to see a spirit kind
"I'm here to guide you on your way"
It spoke in whispers and dressed in gray
"Before you pass, Theres much to show
To bring you peace, you must know"

The dark and dank disappeared from sight
Replaced instead by blinding light
That faded slowly to paint the scene
Of his daughter, but still a teen
Playing in the weeds and dirt and grass
A bittersweet memory of times gone past



The dreamer who dreamed of darker things





The day I saw you I'll not forget
Took months of courage till we finally met
Put on my persona of a confident man
To approach that women who made me say "Damn"
Her dirty blonde hair is royally fair
Her deep blue eyes did clear the air
By her stunning smile I'm simply smitten,
By a vexing lovebug I've been badly bitten
I've half a mind to charge some rent
For the extensive headspace where your name went
I used to have days that I don't remember
But not anymore since we met that September
The prospect of love never felt so exciting
A potential future never looked so inviting
But all that could be came to an end
When she informed him of her boyfriend
Perfection is naught but a daring dream
Wafted away like short-lived steam


But all that could be came to an end
When he remembered about her boyfriend
Perfection is naught but a daring dream
A misplacement of hope and deceitful scheme
