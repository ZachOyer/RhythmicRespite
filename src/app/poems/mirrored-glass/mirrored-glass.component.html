          <h1>Mirror mirror on the wall<br>A vitric mural that light does draw</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="poem-text">
          <div></div>
          <div>As I stand there, reading in between the lines mirror</div>
          <div>Searching the fine print that no one else read</div>
          <div>Looking for the loophole to circumvent ourselves</div>
          <div>When everyone else was content with the summary</div>
          <div></div>
          <div>The mirror allows us to see ourselves,</div>
          <div>never forgetting to think about us and our role in the world.</div>
          <div>The transluscency of the glass allows us to see others as well.</div>
          <div>Our thoughts should consider both ourselves and those around us.</div>

        <br>
        <div class="poem-text">
          <div>And at first glance of the glass, I see my mirror</div>
          <div>Only to mistake it for the universal gateway at my finger tips</div>
          <div>The rainbow reflection that parades any colors one could possible desire</div>
          <div>An enticing entrance to the factual or fictional life of another</div>
          <div>Viewed through the same lens that I watch my own</div>
          <div>Muddling the lines between theirs and mine</div>
          <div>Forced to pick one or the other</div>
          <div>An ostentatious glimpse through the eye of their storm</div>
          <div>Or melancholic meditation with my stentorious black mirror</div>
          <div>Misguiding me to entertain the idea</div>
          <div>That I don't need mine when I have theirs</div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="poem-text">
          <div>Yet I have the chance to pick my place</div>
          <div>Stepping back and forth in an existential dance</div>
          <div>Aligning my reflection with where I want it to be</div>
          <div>Amidst the picture of positive people and pleasing places</div>
          <div>Piecing together the perfect pearlescent puzzle in the glass</div>
          <div>And when I find the ideal distance</div>
          <div>I become my reflection, and my reflection becomes me</div>
          <div>Surrounded by sympathetic souls with open hearts</div>
          <div>In a place of abundant belonging - where I'm meant to be</div>
          <div>I'm free to traverse beyond the edges of before</div>
          <div>While my reflection - returned to his ephemeral cage</div>
          <div>Doomed to vanish with a couple of my steps</div>
          <div>But he's not overwhelmed with vehement rage</div>
          <div>Instead, I see him smile</div>
          <div>I see <span style="font-style: italic">Me</span> smile</div>
