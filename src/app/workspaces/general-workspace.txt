Speculum vitreum - A glass mirror

Vitrum a speculo - glass from the mirror

Vitrum speculis - glass that mirrors

The mirrored glass is the view we need to live our lives with.
The mirror allows us to see ourselves, never forgetting to think
about us and our place in the world. But the translucency of the
glass allows us to see others as well. Our thoughts should consider
both ourselves and those around us

And we can take steps closer or farther away to find the perfect distance
from the mirror, such that our reflection fits where we want to be in our
life and who we want to be surrounded by. And when I found the spot that I
like, I swap places with my reflection. I find myself where I want to be,
surrounded by those I want to be surrounded by, and I look back to my old
new reflection, and I see it smile. I see... Me smile



As lyle sat in his lonely room, he traded his thoughts with the fireplace
The hungry flame threw licks into the air, crackles filling the empty space
Then out the window he heard a song, a lullaby of melancholic delight
His curiosity beckoned him to the glass, but was not answered by his sight
An empty street akin to his room, populated only by his windows reflection
But the song cared not and continued on, coming from an untold direction
Called to adventure by the bodiless tune,

The ballroom empty from wall to wall, but filled with life from his delicate dance
the strings of the bass and keys of the piano serenaded his one-sided romance

He follows the tune into a forest. In the forest he sees a door and enters. It brings him to ball room where he dances eloquently.
He realizes that he is still in his room, and that it was all in his imagination. But an adventure nonetheless. Having fond memories of something that never even happened

Lachrymose
Stuck in the limbo between I like you a lot, while waiting for you to eventually not reciprocate
I want a relationship, but I'm told to wait, and get some good friends instead.
But then its harder to make friendships because they are spending so much time with their own significant other
