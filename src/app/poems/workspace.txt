Speculum vitreum - A glass mirror

Vitrum a speculo - glass from the mirror

Vitrum speculis - glass that mirrors

The mirrored glass is the view we need to live our lives with.
The mirror allows us to see ourselves, never forgetting to think
about us and our place in the world. But the translucency of the
glass allows us to see others as well. Our thoughts should consider
both ourselves and those around us


And we can take steps closer or farther away to find the perfect distance
from the mirror, such that our reflection fits where we want to be in our
life and who we want to be surrounded by. And when I found the spot that I
like, I swap places with my reflection. I find myself where I want to be,
surrounded by those I want to be surrounded by, and I look back to my old
new reflection, and I see it smile. I see... Me smile
