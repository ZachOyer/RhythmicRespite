Speculum vitreum - A glass mirror

Vitrum a speculo - glass from the mirror

Vitrum speculis - glass that mirrors

The mirrored glass is the view we need to live our lives with.
The mirror allows us to see ourselves, never forgetting to think
about us and our place in the world. But the translucency of the
glass allows us to see others as well. Our thoughts should consider
both ourselves and those around us

And we can take steps closer or farther away to find the perfect distance
from the mirror, such that our reflection fits where we want to be in our
life and who we want to be surrounded by. And when I found the spot that I
like, I swap places with my reflection. I find myself where I want to be,
surrounded by those I want to be surrounded by, and I look back to my old
new reflection, and I see it smile. I see... Me smile


So there prepped the fellow who went to Purdue
Excited to finally go out with you
He went to the store and bought some nice clothes
As well as a pleasant petite petaled rose
He cleaned out his car and also his room
Trying his hardest to be the best groom
He drove to the spot where they were to meet
And marched up the sidewalk to his nervous heartbeat
But he forgot all when he locked in those eyes
Hoping she would be the last of his tries
They sat at the table and started to chat
Conversing so well they forgot where they're at
He loved a thing and she loved that too
Never was there a pairing so true
One hour, two hours, three hours gone by
So long that the waiter tried to bid them goodbye
Enjoying the company of a new best friend
But all good things must come to an end
Adieu to you with a kiss on the cheek
Eagerly awaiting our meeting next week
